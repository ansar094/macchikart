				<p><b>Our Team</b><br>
					Machhikart was started as a college project by Atheeq and Mushviq, two 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering students at SJEC.
					They personally source fish from trusted local fishermen they know and handle the initial operations themselves.
					As the business grows, they plan to bring in partners to help with deliveries, ensuring that every order reaches customers fresh, safe, and ready to enjoy.</p>
